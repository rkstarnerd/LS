x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end

What does the each method in the following program return after it is 
finished executing?

This returns the value of x, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
You could use x.map instead of x.each if you wanted to return an array
that was the result of adding 1 to each element.
