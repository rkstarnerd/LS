Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources 
and say which one you like best and why.

For Ruby, I prefer ruby-doc.org.  I find the examples to be easy to 
understand. I also can see clearly the type of objects that can be 
passed into methods, if applicable, and what types of objects will
be returned.

For Rails, i prefer http://api.rubyonrails.org/.  I like how it's easy
to search for particular methods on the side.
It's similar to Dash, another program I use to quickly search and
browse API documentation for different languages.
