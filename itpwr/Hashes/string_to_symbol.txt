Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}


What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

my_hash = {:x=>"some value"}
my_hash2 = {"hi there"=>"some value"} 

In my_hash x: is a symbol and has a different value/meaning than
the variable x.
