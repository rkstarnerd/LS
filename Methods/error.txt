ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'


The above error message tells me that on the fourth line in irb the method
calculate_product is called with only one argument when it requires two
as defined on line one.
